# 1. Assembly Reflections:
## What did you notice about registers and instructions?
Unlike high-level programming languages, assembly instructions operate directly on the registers, which are like the CPU's built-in storage. Every instruction reuires a register as a destination. 
In this simple calculator, 2 and 3 couldn't be added without moving them first into registers.
The instructions are mnemonics that are short and human-readable, for instance, mov copies data into registers.

## How is coding in assembly different from python?
Assembly language is low-level programming language that is tedious to learn, read and write. Writing in assembly takes much longer time. Even for something simple, like mov or add, every tiny step must be spelled out. Python is high-level programming language that has less tedious syntax as compared to assemby language.
